# GraphQL
GraphQL demo, example and code snippets from my study of two books - Learning GraphQL and Relay - 2016 (By Samer Buna) and Learning GraphQL - 2018 (By Eve Porcello and Alex Banks)
The code samples are modified to my taste and understanding for easy future referenece and for compatibility with current version of packages and build tools.
